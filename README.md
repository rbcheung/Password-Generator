# Password-Generator

This project was to get us to use what have learnt in the previous lessons and apply it to a more practical scenario.

This application allowed us to practice Javascript to generate a random, secure password for the user based on their criteria/requirements.

The HTML and CSS is untouched as the focus was on JS.

This project required us to hit the following requirements;

* Generate a password when the button is clicked
  * Present a series of prompts for password criteria
    * Length of password
      * At least 8 characters but no more than 128.
    * Character types
      * Lowercase
      * Uppercase
      * Numeric
      * Special characters ($@%&*, etc)
  * Code should validate for each input and at least one character type should be selected
  * Once prompts are answered then the password should be generated and displayed in an alert or written to the page
